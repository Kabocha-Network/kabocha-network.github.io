# Key Concepts

## Network Publics
Network Publics are decentralised trusts that allow communities to instantiate their own sovereign realities. It further distils the cliched concept of Web 3 and  aims to provide a canvass for communities to build truly sovereign decentralised and localised (or non-proximal) systems, networks and societies. 

Network Publics enable the sustainable funding of creative contributions from borderless work forces, enabled through on-chain governance, curated proposals and an aligned value capture mechanism.

A Network Public is a decentralised trust that sits on its own sovereign blockchain. The blockchain may be a parachain or relay chain with its own out-of-the box modules (substrate pallets) that allow the community of participants to interface with each other, financially, lawfully and culturally.

## Publiks
Network Publics have a resource of opinionated Substrate design templates known as _Publiks_, which has various versioned release that fit the varied requirements and needs of users.
