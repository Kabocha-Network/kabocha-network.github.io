# What is Kabocha?

Kabocha is a holistic self-evolving grass-roots parachain project, funding and incubating teams to build new public infrastructure. 

It is an experiment in crafting new realities through direct participation, collaborative creation and shared values. 
Its ownership and governance is fair, transparent and decentralised at launch thanks to its genesis in the Edgeware community. 

The project introduces a Network Public template and novel Store of Values currency and is built with the Substrate framework.

## Kabocha is a Network Public
We are paving the way for decentralised communities to have their own jurisidction of law through [Network Publics](/docs/intro/key-concepts#network-publics). A Network Public is a Decentralised True Trust. Network Publics handle their own affairs and disputes, and do not require any other state or jurisidction to handle matters for us unless we give them express consent to.
