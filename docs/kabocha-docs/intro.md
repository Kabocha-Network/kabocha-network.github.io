# Intro

**Repo**: https://github.com/kabocha-network/parachain 

**Branch**: https://github.com/kabocha-network/parachain/tree/kab-release-v0.2.5-new

**Genesis Proposal**: https://gov.edgewa.re/discussion/2363-kabocha-kab-a-kusama-parachain-project-by-edgeware

Kabocha parachain is the first part of the process of our multi-chain "network plan". 

## What will connecting to Kusama provide?

Connecting to Kusama will allow:

- The projects we fund through our treasury to have access to the Kusama ecosystem; 
- Open up secure interoperability with other chains; 
- Provide KAB with a KAB/KSM pair on a DEX; 
- Bridge to our future relay chains, (meaning Kabocha parachain will connect our future relay chains to the DotSama ecosystem). 


## Summary 

- Launch Kabocha parachain on Kusama
- Bring Edgeware into the Kusama ecosystem and bring alive a narrative that aligns with Kusamaâ€™s experimental nature and arts and culture focus.  
- Inspire a playground of possibilities and empower contributions from a diverse network of talent from around the world who are funded in a sustainable and scalable way. 
- Accelerate projects that build the Kabocha and Kusama metaverse and Subverse.
- Wen Crowdloan? Pre-register at Kabocha website
- Wen Snapshot? 14 days after a successful parachain auction
- What percentage of KAB is for the crowdloan? 4.9%.
