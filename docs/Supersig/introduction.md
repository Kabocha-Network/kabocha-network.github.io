# Introduction

Supersig is like multisig but with some superpowers. It is designed to be can be fit for more versatile governance of permissionless collectives. The simple feature improvements from using multisig are: 

- **Add/remove** members; 
- **simpleMajority threshold** instead of fixed threshold; 
- **"Master" user** (optional), which gives one person 50% voting power, useful for specific usecases. 
- **Same fixed address**. 

The main trade off to multisig is that you cannot create a supersig in a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#:~:text=A%20cryptographic%20hash%20function%20must,value%20for%20any%20given%20message) way.
